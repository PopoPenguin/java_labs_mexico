    you can use it to specify the path to the classes

3) What does the package structure mirror?

7) What keyword is used to specify that a class is going to use a separate interface?

8) What makes interfaces so useful?
    allows separation of implementation; can use default implementation in order to not break existing code

9) What was added in JDK 8 that makes interfaces even more useful?
    default implementation - allows ability to specify some behavior without breaking code

10) How many interfaces can a single class implement?
    one
