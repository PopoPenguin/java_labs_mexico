Answer the following questions:

1) What is an array?

    an array is a collection of variables of same data type referred to by a common name

2) What the code required to create (instantiate) a String array with size 10 named "cats"?

    String cats[] = new String [10];

3) What is a multidimensional array?

    An array that consists of multiple arrays

4) What is the code required to create (instantiate) a 2-dimensional int array that is 6 high and 6 wide named "scores"?

    int scores [] [] = new int [6] [6];

5) Using code, how do you retrieve a String that is the 10th item in a traditional array named dogs?

    System.out.println(dogs [10]);

6) What is an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException?
    when you are indexing out of the size of the array


7) Using one line of code, demonstrate how to retrieve the second to the last item from a int array.
    str[str.length-2]

8) What is the maximum allowable size of an array in Java?
    same size as interger - 5

9) What is a bubble sort?
    is a linear sorting program


10) How does a bubble sort work?
    it compares two positions in the array and compares their values, if a value is less than the other it will
    substitute into a temporary variable and adjust the new index positions
    then it will assign the temporary value into the new index position

11) When might you use an irregular array? What is a good example of an irregular array?
    When you have an array of different lengths
    A bus schedule will have the same run times except on the weekend

12) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a for loop.
    for (int i=0; i<array.length; i++){
        sout (array[i]);


13) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a while loop.
    int i =0;
    while(i!=array.length-1;){
    sout (array[i]);
    i++;
    }



14) What is a queue?
    is a type of data structure in which elements can be accessed first in first out order only

15) What are the two primary operations that a queue performs?
    put and get


16) What is a stack?
    is a type of data structure in which elements are accessed first in last out order only


17) What differentiates stacks and queues?
    first in last out vs first in first out


18) When would you use an enhanced for loop?
    when you need to cycle through an array


19) What is "The Collections Framework"? What classes does it include?
    is a set of classes that implement various data structures
    includes list, vectors, sets, and maps


20) How do you iterate over a two-dimensional array? Demonstrate using psuedo code.
    you would need to use an enhanced for loop and create an array of the variable
    for (int x[]: nums){
        for(int y: x){
            sout ( y )
        }
    }

21) What is a String?
    A string is an object data type enclosed by " " that contains characters

22) What are a few common methods for operating on Strings?
    .length ; .equals ; .compareTo ; .lastIndexOf ;

23) What does "Strings are immutable" mean?
    the string or character sequence cannot be altered.

24) Using the CLI, how do you invoke a Java application and provide two parameters to the main method?
    java name_Class one two [enter]
