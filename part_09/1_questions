1) What is the difference between a byte stream and a character stream?
    a byte stream takes in one byte at a time and deals with input and output of bytes
    a character stream reads in by two bytes and deals with reading in and out of characters

2) List at least 3 examples of byte stream classes?
    InputStream
    OutputStream
    DataInputStream

3) List at least 3 examples of character stream classes?
    BufferedReader
    BufferedWriter
    FileReader

4) What is try-with-resources? Why is it super cool?
    try-with-resource is a way to declare and initialize a resource and ensure it is closed once it is not used

5) Demonstrate a try-wth-resources block:
    try (FileInputStream fileIn = new FileInputStream(args[0])){
        do {
            i = fileIn.read();
            if(i != -1) System.out.print((char) i);
         } while (i != -1);

    } catch (IOException exc) {
        sout ("I/O Error: " + exc);

6) What does the read() method on the FileInputStream class return?
    integers

7) What is the documentation above of the FileInputStream class header say? (hint: inside /** ... */)
    opens a fileinput stream by creating a connection to an actual file, checks if there is security,
    then if file is not there or is in another directory throws a FileNotFoundException

8) Is a DataOutputStream used for bytes or characters?
    bytes

9) What is a BufferedReader?
    it is a data stream for characters that creates a buffer for input character stream

10) Why does a BufferedReader require an InputStreamReader as an argument?
    Because it reads characters from an inputstream.  Part of the constructor

11) What does the InputStreamReader dp with it's byte stream argument?
    it turns them into characters

12) What is the difference between the read() and readLine() on BufferedReader?
    read() reads each character while readLine() reads the line of text.

13) Demonstrate instantiating a BufferedReader that will read a file called "yucatan_cenotes.txt"
    try (BufferedReader helpRdr = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(yucatan_cenotes.txt)))
