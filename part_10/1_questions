1) What is the difference between the Thread and Runnable?
    Thread is the class and Runnable is an interface
2) How do you start a thread using Runnable?
    create a thread that implements Runnable

    public class ExampleThread implements Runnable {
        Thread thrd;
        public ExampleThread (String name){
            thrd = new Thread (this, name);
            thrd.start();
        }

        @Override
        public void run(){}
    }

3) How do you start a thread using Thread?
    create a class that extends Thread ;

4) How do you get a thread's name?
    thrd.getName();

5) What does the "synchronize()" method do?
    it synchronizes a block of code so any methods of the object class that you do not have access to will be synchronized
    with the block.

6) What does the "join()" method do?
    it is a more efficient way to ensure multiple threads complete before the main thread completes

7) What does the "sleep()" method do?
    pauses the thread for a certain amount of time or until is awoken/notified

8) What is the one method you must write if you're implementing the Runnable class?
    public void run(){}

9) Should you create that same method if you're extending Thread?
    yes

10) Why is multi-threading so cool?
    allows multiple processes to be ran when there are no dependencies required for the code to work
