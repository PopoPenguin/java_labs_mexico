Using MySQLWorkbench do the following

1) create a new blank database with the name "car_dealership"

2) create a new table named "users_cars" with the following fields:
    - id (auto increment)
    - userID (refers to "id" in users table)
    - carID (refers to "id" in cars table)


2) create a new table named "users" with the following fields
    - id (auto increment)
    - first name
    - last name

3) create a new table named "cars" with the following fields
    - id (auto increment)
    - make
    - model
    - color
    - year

4) populate these tables with at least 5 records each - the more the merrier

5) Write the SQL queries to accomplish the following: (write each of your queries below for review)
    - select all records from users
        select * from car_dealership.users
    - select all records from cars where car make = "Toyota"
        select *
        from cars
        where make = "Toyota"
    - use a join to select the first name and car model of every user who has bought a car
        select u.first_name as FirstName, c.model as CarModel
        from users u
        join users_cars uc
    		on u.id = uc.user_id
    	join cars c
    		on uc.car_id = c.id
    - use a join to select the first and last name of everyone who has bought a red car
        select u.first_name as FirstName, u.last_name as LastName
        from users u
        join users_cars uc
    	    on u.id = uc.user_id
        join cars c
    	    on uc.car_id = c.id
        where c.color like  "%red%"
    - use an insert statement to create a new record in each table
        insert into users (first_name, last_name)
        values ("John", "Doe")

        insert into cars (make, model, color, year)
        values ("Tesla", "X","Yellow", 2013)

        insert into users_cars(user_id, car_id)
        values (8,7)

    - use sql to update a record in the "cars" table
        update cars
        set year = 2007
        where id = 3


6) Using MySQLWorkbench, export the the "users_cars", "users" and "cars" schema with all objects and data into a
self-contained sql file. - check the exported file into git
